* Bits and Pieces
Bits and pieces is a repository containing exactly that, bits and pieces of
code. This may include tools that are too small for their own repo, functions
which may be useful in other programs, and pieces to practice various techniques
and concepts.

These are not guaranteed to be good, stay working, or even work in the first
place.
